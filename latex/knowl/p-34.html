<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Among the three formats (HTML, PDF, print), the HTML is optimal for display in class if you have a suitable projector.  The HTML is also best for navigation, as links to internal and external references are much more obvious.  We recommend saving a downloaded version of the PDF format as a backup in the event you don't have internet access.  It's a good idea for each student to have a printed version of the Activities Workbook, which you can acquire as a PDF document by direct request to the author (boelkinm at gvsu dot edu); many instructors use the PDF to have coursepacks printed for students to purchase from their local bookstore.</p>
