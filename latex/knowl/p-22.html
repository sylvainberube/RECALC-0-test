<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">There are dozens of college algebra and trignometry texts with (collectively) tens of thousands of exercises. Rather than repeat standard and routine exercises in this text, we recommend the use of WeBWorK with its access to the Open Problem Library (OPL) and many thousands of relevant problems. In this text, each section includes a small collection of anonymous WeBWorK exercises that offer students immediate feedback without penalty, as well as 3â€“4 additional challenging exercises per section. Each of the non-WeBWorK exercises has multiple parts, requires the student to connect several key ideas, and expects that the student will do at least a modest amount of writing to answer the questions and explain their findings.</p>
