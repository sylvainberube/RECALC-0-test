<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">As you use the book, think of it as a workbook, not a worked-book.  There is a great deal of scholarship that shows people learn better when they interactively engage and struggle with ideas themselves, rather than passively watch others.  Thus, instead of reading worked examples or watching an instructor complete examples, you will engage with Activities that prompt you to grapple with concepts and develop deep understanding.  You should expect to spend time in class working with peers on Activities and getting feedback from them and from your instructor.  You can ask your instructor for a copy of the PDF file that has only the activities along with room to record your work.  Your goal should be to do all of the activities in the relevant sections of the text and keep a careful record of your work.  </p>
